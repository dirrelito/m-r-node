This is a clone of the M-R library that is the standard CQRS implementation, by Greg Young.

I also hope to reimplement the front end.

# Instructions

run `npm install`
then start the back end server with `npm run watch` and the front end server with `ng serve`.
Run these commands in two different consoles!
